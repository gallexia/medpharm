To measure the peak amplitude of tissue contractions:

a) Click the **Stop** button to stop recording.



b) Using the scroll bar at the bottom of the chart display, select a section of the recording containing the tissue contraction to be measured. You can also adjust the size of the display window by entering a new duration into the Window Size box or expand or contract the window using the arrow buttons.

c) Drag the measurement cursor on the chart display to the point on the recording trace to be measured (the peak of nerve stimulated responses, or the plateau of agonist responses). The contractile force at the cursor point (in units of gms.) is displayed below the cursor.
