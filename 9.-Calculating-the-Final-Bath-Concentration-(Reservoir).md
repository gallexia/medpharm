When adding drugs to the reservoir, the final bath concentration (FBC), in M (Moles/litre)., is related to the stock solution concentration [stock] (in M) the volume of stock added to the reservoir (in ml) and the reservoir volume (ml) by the formula,

        [stock] x Volume added

[FBC] = ----------------------

               Reservoir volume

To determine the volume to add to achieve a specified FBC:

a) Select the Dilution Formula page and **Volume to Add** as the Result.

b) Enter the reservoir volume (1000 ml) into the **Bath Volume** box, 

c) Enter the required FBC in the **Final Bath Conc** box.

d) Enter the selected stock solution concentration in the **Stock Soln. Conc.** box.

e) Click the **Calculate** button.
